# Version 2 Requirements

## Front End

* Epic: As a user, I want to have an easily navigable set of pages to view, add, and edit wikis, so that I can use this app to it's full potential.
  * User Story: As a wiki reader, I want to be able to navigate all available wikis in an alphabetical list, so that I can easily find the wiki that I want to access.
  * User Story: As a wiki creator, I want to have a persistent add button on the wiki list, so that when the wiki I want does not exist, I can easily go to the form to create one.
  * User Story: As a wiki viewer, I want to have a page that displays the current wiki I have navigated to with buttons to go to either the episodes or the characters list, so that I can easily tell what wiki I am on and be able to navigate to its contents.
  * User Story: As a wiki viewer, I want to have a page that displays the list of parts (episodes/chapters) in the current wiki that will direct me to the part page when clicked, so that I can navigate through the list of episodes and choose the one I want to read more about.
  * User Story: As a wiki viewer, I want to have a page for the specific part I am interested in, and 
  * User Story: As a wiki editor, I want to have a persistent add button on the parts list and part pagees, so that I can add missing parts anywhere in the parts section of the application.
